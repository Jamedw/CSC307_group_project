The Reddit But Better app is an a web application that is made for reddit users  
and fourm users that want a fourm focused on Cal Poly students. This app will  
be an open discussion platfrom that will enhance the daily lives of cal poly  
students. The app will centralize information about cal poly and the community  
while also removing any data collection and microtransactions.  

In this project we have implemented a way for a person to navigate as a guest  
or a signed in user. If the user is logged in we will show their communities on  
the side bar. The project allows for you to look at a community page and a post page. We also have authentication for login and sign up. All write requests
